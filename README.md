# React + Vite: Todo List Project

This project is a simple Todo List application built using React and Vite. It demonstrates how to create, manage, and organize tasks efficiently while leveraging the fast development experience provided by Vite.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Filter tasks by their status (e.g., all, active, completed).
- Persistent storage using local storage.

## Plugins Used

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

For a production-ready Todo List application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Refer to the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) into your project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Open the application in your browser and start managing your tasks!
